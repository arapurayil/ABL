### About

- The focus here is on generating a list which doesn't hamper usability while not compromising on privacy/security.  
  
- The sources for the list is carefully curated to include lists which are regularly maintained and have minimum overlaps.  
  
- Whitelists are extensively employed to make sure false positives do not occur.  
  
- By making use of regex and ABP style the size of the list is kept to a minimum.  
  - If a domain is already blocked, its subdomains are removed from the list.  
  - By employing regex rules, only those rules which are not matched are kept on.  
  - The whitelist is compared with the regex rules to ensure no safe-domain is ensured that no useful domain is inadvertently blocked.  
  
### Usage  

- [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/)  
- [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky/)  
  
NOTE: It will work wherever ABP format is supported, ex: ublock origin, but is best used for filtering DNS queries.  
  
### Support  

- Report false-positives or bad domains  
- Improve generator script by making a PR

## General List

**Blocks ads & annoyances, analytics & trackers, crypto-jacking &
resource abusers, malware, and phishing. Addon lists are available in
the repo.**

- Sources: 58
- Rules before processing: 173835
- Rules after processing: 151595

By using regex rules and by removing duplicates, false-positives and redundant sub-domains the **aBL - General List is 12.79% lighter** than its combined sources
